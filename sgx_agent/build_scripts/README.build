Pre-requisite for the SGX Agent build system
=============================================

RHEL8 package Requirements
==========================
- Following RHEL 8 repositories should be setup and available (/etc/yum.repos.d) to download and resolve SGX Agent package dependencies
	BaseOS
	AppStream
	CodeReady
- Ensure that dnf update can download and install latest software updates
	If dnf update installs new kernel, make sure to restart the build vm for the new kernel to take effect
- dnf install git
- Ensure that the system date is properly setup (to PDT time)

Git Access
==========
- SGX Agent source code is hosted in gitlab. Ensure that access is available to these repositories
- To download source code, the SSH keys of the build system needs to be uploaded into gitlab
	To generate ssh keys, run ssh-keygen and follow the instructions. SSH Public key will be stored in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
	copy the id_rsa.pub contents in settings ==> SSH Keys section in gitlab

How to Build
=============
- To build SGX Agent, 
# git clone ssh://git@gitlab.devtools.intel.com:29418/sst/isecl/sgx-tools.git
# cd sgx-tools/sgx_agent/build_scripts/
#./sagent_build.sh
- This script will generate a tarball(sgx_agent.tar) and checksum file(sgx_agent.sha2)
- Copy sgx_agent.tar, sgx_agent.sha2 and untar.sh(from sgx_agent directory) to a directory in the deployment machine
