Pre Requisites
--------------
- VM/Server running RHEL 8.1

- RHEL package repositories are setup and dnf updates are completed

- root account access. All SKC Components are installed with root user permissions

- Get access to the following SKC components git repositories in gitlab
	Authentiction and Authorization Service (AAS) - https://gitlab.devtools.intel.com/sst/isecl/authservice
	Certificate Management Service (CMS) - https://gitlab.devtools.intel.com/sst/isecl/certificate-management-service
	SGX Caching Service (SCS) - https://gitlab.devtools.intel.com/sst/isecl/sgx-caching-service
	SGX Quote Verification Service (SQVS) - https://gitlab.devtools.intel.com/sst/isecl/sgx-verification-service
	SGX Host Verification Service (SHVS) - https://gitlab.devtools.intel.com/sst/isecl/sgx-hvs
	SGX Hub Service (SHUB) - https://gitlab.devtools.intel.com/sst/isecl/sgx-ah

- Configure http_proxy and https_proxy in case machines are accessed through proxy server

- configure no_proxy and add loopback address/ vm ip and sgx server ip

- create ssh key using ssh-keygen

- copy the content of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to the Gitlab, https://gitlab.devtools.intel.com/sst/isecl (UserProfile->Settings->SSH Keys->Add Key)

- create ~/.gitconfig file and copy the following content in it:
    [user]
            email = <intel mail id>
            name = <intel username>
    [color]
            ui = true
    [url "ssh://git@gitlab.devtools.intel.com:29418/"]
            insteadOf = https://gitlab.devtools.intel.com/
    [core]
            filemode = false
Save and close


Building all SKC Golang Components
----------------------------------
# ./build_skc.sh
 This will clone and build following SKC golang services
	Authentiction and Authorization Service (AAS)
	Certificate Management Service (CMS)
	SGX Caching Service (SCS)
	SGX Quote Verification Service (SQVS)
	SGX Host Verification Service (SHVS)
	SGX Hub Service (SHUB)
	Key Broker Service (KBS) - This is a java service which is directly deployed from a binary

The source code will be checked out to ~/skc folder and built binaries will be available in ~/skc/bin

After build is completed, please update the IP address of the VM/machine where these services need to be installed in skc.conf
As of now all these components need to be installed on same VM/Machine where they are built
(please note that these services dont need SGX enabled serve for build or deployment)


Deploying all SKC Golang Components
-----------------------------------
# ./install_skc.sh
 This script will install all SKC golang services along with databases, user accounts and roles asscoiated for each user

To check if installation is successful, following command can be used
# netstat -lntp (if netstat command is not available, run dnf install net-tools) 

Alternatively each service status can be checked as follows
# cms status
# authservice status
# scs status
# sqvs status
# shvs status
# shub status
# kms status

Turn off Firewall service or ensure that these services can be accessed from the machine where SGX Agent/SKC_Library is running
# systemctl stop firewalld

Configuration files for all SKC golang components can be found in /etc directory (for ex: /etc/cms/)

Log files are accessible from /var/log directory (for ex: /var/log/cms/cms.log)

For Key Broker service, installation is done at /opt/kms directory.
	configuration files are found in /opt/kms/configuration
	log file for KBS is at /opt/kms/logs/kms.log
